# Bike rental prediction
As a requirement of the Udacity Deep Learning Foundation Nano Degree program, a deep learning neural network model was developed to make
predictions on the number of future bike rentals by training the model on a dataset of features. Only features identified to impact the number of bike rentals were chosen to train the model.
